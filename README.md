# JSONConvert

This simple program is just a demo that converts a sample database into a JSON structure and saves it to a file. It uses multiple JSON libraries to compare how they're used and was built to add to the discussion on JSON at the October 2025 meeting of the Oregon Delphi User Group.

## Project

This was built with Delphi 13 using the VCL framework but could likely be compiled in Delphi 11 or 12.

## Database

The included SQLite database is a copy of the Chinook sample database that can be found many places around the web.
